# CS 3300

This repository contains my final project for the course CS 3300: Introduction to Software Engineering.

CS 3300 builds a solid foundation for developing and maintaining sustainable codebases through modern practices. Version control, project management styles, coding best practices, cloud services, and web technologies were used to create deployable products and maintain work.

I completed this course at UCCS in December 2021. The final Heroku app for this project can be viewed via the link below.
